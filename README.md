# PayEver

Hello!!!

Before You Run Tests, Please Go To ----> main/common/data.js  and change email_id to 1234 (it is for E-mail Generation)

test_runners.spec.js is Entry point of my code.

for running Test Scenarios, please Enter "npm run test" command in terminal and press enter

I also could describe webElements in seperate class as pageFactory but, because of input field structure on this website, which needs two actions two fill fields click() and sendKeys() i think that main/common/basepage.js - element_selector() was better solution

Reports:

Massege Icon is not present in the dashboard,  
Industry field is not neccessary for creating a new account

Thanks.

P.S. if I had a little bit of time i would've done much better :D
